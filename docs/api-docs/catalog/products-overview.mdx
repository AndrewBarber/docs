# Catalog Overview



The Catalog refers to a store's collection of physical and digital products. The Catalog includes all the information about a product such as MPN, warranty, price, and images.

## OAuth scopes

| UI Name  | Permission | Parameter |
|:---------|:-----------|:----------|
| Products | modify | `store_v2_products` |
| Products | read-only | `store_v2_products_read_only` |

For more information on OAuth Scopes and authentication, see our [Guide to API Accounts](/api-docs/getting-started/api-accounts#oauth-scopes).

## Products overview

[Products](/docs/rest-management/catalog/products) are the primary catalog entity, and the primary function of the ecommerce platform is to sell products on the storefront and through other channels.


Products can be physical or digital:
* **Physical** - Material goods that have a weight and take up space.  Merchants ship them out, or customers pick them up.

* **Digital** - Intangible purchases that represent virtual goods, licenses, services, or events.  Customers download, redeem, experience, or attend them.


<Callout type="info">
  You can only create one product per request.
</Callout>

## Creating a product

The following request to the [Create a product](/docs/rest-catalog/products#create-a-product) endpoint creates a physical product with no modifiers or variant options.

```http filename="Example request: Create a physical product" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/catalog/products
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "name": "BigCommerce Coffee Mug",
  "price": 10.00,
  "categories": [
    23,
    21
  ],
  "weight": 4,
  "type": "physical"
}
```

## Creating products with variant options

**Variant options** represent important product properties, such as size and color.

To create a product with variant options, include a `variants` array in the body of a request to the [Create a product](/docs/rest-catalog/products#create-a-product) endpoint.

```http filename="Example request: Create a product with variants" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/catalog/products
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "name": "BigCommerce Coffee Mug",
  "price": 10.00,
  "categories": [
    23,
    21
  ],
  "weight": 4,
  "type": "physical",
  "variants": [
    {
      "sku": "SKU-BLU",
      "option_values": [
        {
          "option_display_name": "Mug Color",
          "label": "Blue"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "sku": "SKU-GRAY",
      "option_values": [
        {
          "option_display_name": "Mug Color",
          "label": "Gray"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  When you create variant options using the `/products` endpoint, the `display_type` defaults to radio buttons. In some themes, radio buttons appear as selectable boxes.
</Callout>

## Creating digital products

To create a digital product, set the `type` to `digital` in the body of a request to the [Create a product](/docs/rest-catalog/products#create-a-product) endpoint.

```http filename="Example request: Create a digital product" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/catalog/products
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "name": "ebook: A Guide to Coffee",
  "price": 10.00,
  "categories": [
    23,
    21
  ],
  "type": "digital",
  "images": [
    {
      "is_thumbnail": true,
      "image_url": "{{image_url}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  You can only upload files to attach to digital products using [WebDAV or your control panel](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Creating-Downloadable-Products). The API does not support uploading assets other than product photos. You can use the store control panel to set additional settings, such as file descriptions and maximum downloads.
</Callout>

## Adding product images

To add an image to a product, send a request to the [Create a product image](/docs/rest-catalog/products#create-a-product-image) endpoint. The following request adds a product image using an externally hosted image's existing URL as the data source:

```http filename="Example request: Add a product image by image_url" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/catalog/products/{{product_id}}/images
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "is_thumbnail": true,
  "sort_order": 1,
  "description": "Yellow Large Bath Towel",
  "image_url": "{{image_url}}"
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  Products are limited to **1,000** images in total, including any images associated with variants. Consult []() for additional product image-related limits.
</Callout>

The following request associates a previously-uploaded image with a product using the [Create a product image](/docs/rest-catalog/products#create-a-product-image) endpoint.

When you use the `image_file` property to associate an image with a product, set the `Content-Type` header to `multipart/form-data`. Otherwise, you will be unable to add subsequent requests.

```http filename="Example request: Add a previously uploaded product image" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/catalog/products/{{product_id}}/images
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "is_thumbnail": false, //additional image
  "sort_order": 1,
  "description": "Yellow Large Bath Towel",
  "image_file": "{{image_path}}" //previously uploaded to BigCommerce
}
```

To use an image on product listing pages, set `is_thumbnail` to true. A product can have only one thumbnail image at a time. If only one image is associated with a product, it is both the main product image and the thumbnail.

You can also add variant-specific images when [creating a variant](/docs/rest-catalog/product-variants#create-a-product-variant).

## Adding product videos

Currently, the Catalog API exclusively supports adding YouTube videos. A product can have more than one video.

To add a YouTube-hosted video to a product, send a request to the [Create a product video](/docs/rest-catalog/products#create-a-product-video) endpoint.

```http filename="Example request: Add a product video" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/catalog/products/{{product_id}}/videos
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "title": "BigCommerce Mug Video",
  "description": "Video Describing the Mug",
  "sort_order": 1,
  "type": "youtube",
  "video_id": "_KMh8yqDSlg"
}
```

The BigCommerce `video_id` corresponds to the `v` parameter in the YouTube URL. For example, the video hosted at `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMh8yqDSlg` has a `video_id` of `_KMh8yqDSlg`.

## Adding custom fields

To add custom fields to a product, send a request to the [Create a custom field](/docs/rest-catalog/products#create-a-custom-field) endpoint.

```http filename="Example request: Create a custom field" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/catalog/products/{{product_id}}/custom-fields
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "name": "Release Year",
  "value": "2018"
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  Custom field values are limited to **250** characters. For more about using custom fields, see [Custom Fields](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Custom-Fields).
</Callout>

## Adding bulk pricing rules

To add bulk pricing to products based on purchase quantity, send a request to the [Create a bulk pricing rule](/docs/rest-catalog/products#create-a-bulk-pricing-rule) endpoint.

```http filename="Example request: Create a bulk pricing rule" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/catalog/products/{{product_id}}/bulk-pricing-rules
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "bulk_pricing_rules": [
    {
      "quantity_min": 10,
      "quantity_max": 15,
      "type": "price",
      "amount": 3
    },
    {
      "quantity_min": 16,
      "quantity_max": 25,
      "type": "price",
      "amount": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

For details about configuring bulk prices, see [Bulk Pricing](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Bulk-Pricing).

## Pricing precision

BigCommerce pricing is precise up to `4` decimal places. For example:

* `"$ 10.99999` rounds up to `$ 11`
* `"$ 10.99994` rounds down to `$ 10.9999`

Currency display settings allow for more than four decimal places. In such cases, the additional decimal places will display as `0`s.

## Adding product metafields

[Metafields](/docs/rest-catalog/products#create-a-product-metafield) are key-value pairs intended to programmatically store data about a product or other entity. Metafield data does not appear in the storefront or the control panel, but can be useful to improve your catalog's integration with another service, such as a shipping app.

To add metafields to a product, send a request to the [Create a product metafield](/docs/rest-catalog/products#create-a-product-metafield) endpoint.

```http filename="Example request: Create a product metafield" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/catalog/products/{{product_id}}/metafields
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "permission_set": "read",
  "namespace": "Location",
  "key": "bin_number",
  "value": "#4456",
  "description": "location of the product",
  "resource_type": "product",
  "resource_id": 131
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  In the Catalog API, you can add metafields to products, variants, categories, and brands.
</Callout>

## Adding product reviews

To add reviews to a product, send a request to the [Create a product review](/docs/rest-catalog/products#create-a-product-review) endpoint.

```http filename="Example request: Add a product review" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/catalog/products/{{product_id}}/reviews
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "title": "Great Coffee Mug",
  "text": "This coffee mug kept my liquids hot for several hours.",
  "status": "pending",
  "rating": 5,
  "email": "testing@bigcommerce.com",
  "name": "BigCommerce",
  "date_reviewed": "2021-07-20T17:45:13+00:00"
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  You cannot create reviews in the control panel.
</Callout>

## Product variants

Products vary, and those differences matter.  [Product variants](/docs/rest-catalog/product-variants) represent items that customers can purchase.  One style of shoes, for instance, can come in an assortment of sizes, colors, and materials.  If the product is signature sneakers, the variant is a brick-colored pair of signature sneakers with white soles and marine plastic uppers in US women's size 9.  

Everything a customer can buy is a variant. A product with no options is its own variant - called a _base variant_. Variants are the unit against which merchants track inventory.

<Callout type="info">
  Each variant has a unique _SKU_.
</Callout>

Variants can have properties that differ from their parent product, such as price, weight, and unique images. However, if you do not specify distinct variant properties, the variant inherits from the parent product.

## Variant options and variant option values

In the preceding example, every meaningfully distinct pair of shoes is a product variant. [Variant options](/docs/rest-catalog/product-variant-options) are the facets that distinguish the shoes from each other, such as size, color, etc. _Variant option values_ represent the actual sizes and colors the shoes come in.

| Variant options | Variant option values | No. of variants |
|:----------------|:----------------------|----------------:|
| size (US Women's) | 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5 | 10 |
| upper material | canvas, marine plastic, leather | 3 |
| upper color | brick, azul, gold | 3 |
| sole color | charcoal, white, azul | 3 |
|  |  | **270** |

In theory, the preceding variant options and variant option values form 270 possible distinct variants of signature sneakers. 

When you configure variant options in the store control panel or using the [Create a product](/docs/rest-catalog/products#create-a-product) endpoint, the Catalog API generates the set of possible variants, but does not assign them SKUs. You can add SKUs to variants later using the [Update variants (batch)](/docs/rest-catalog/product-variants#batch-update-variants) endpoint.

If a product has variants, the shopper must select a value for each variant option before adding the variant to their cart. On the frontend, the shopper typically chooses between variant option values by manipulating a UI element, such as one of the following:

* **rectangle**
* **radio button**
* **swatch**
* **product pick list**
* **product pick list with images**

<Callout type="info">
  **Catalog V3 versus V2**
  V3's _variants_ correspond with V2's _SKUs_. However, V3's _base variants_ do not correspond with V2 SKUs.
</Callout>

### Create variant options

The following request [Creates a variant option](/docs/rest-catalog/product-variant-options#create-a-variant-option) and populates it with variant option values for the customer to choose between. In a separate request, you can add SKUs representing the resulting variants.

<Callout type="info">
  **Catalog V3 versus V2**
  If a product has options created using the V2 API, you cannot add variant options using the V3 API.
</Callout>

```http filename="Example request: Create variant options" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/catalog/products/{{product_id}}/options
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "product_id": 134,
  "name": "Size Rectangle",
  "display_name": "Size",
  "type": "rectangles",
  "option_values": [
    {
      "label": "S",
      "sort_order": 0,
      "is_default": false
    },
    {
      "label": "M",
      "sort_order": 1,
      "is_default": true
    },
    {
      "label": "L",
      "sort_order": 2,
      "is_default": false
    }
  ]
}
```

To add new values to an existing variant option, use the [Update a variant option](/docs/rest-catalog/product-variant-options#update-a-variant-option) endpoint.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Catalog V3 versus V2 SKU rules**
  V2 SKU rules override variant pricing. If you create SKU rules using the V2 API or CSV import, those rules will alter or override any variant price or sale price added to a product using the control panel, the V3 API, or the Price Lists UI.
</Callout>

## Creating variants

You can create variants in two ways:

You can define variants by specifying options and SKUs when you initially create the product, using the [Create a product]() endpoint. You can also use existing variant options and the [Create a product variant]() endpoint to add new variants.

The following example sequence uses existing variant options to create variants.

First, view all the existing product variant options using the [Get all product variant options]() endpoint.

```json filename="Example response: Get product variant options" showLineNumbers copy
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 193,
      ...
      "option_values": [
        {
          "id": 163,
          "label": "S",
          "sort_order": 0,
          "value_data": null,
          "is_default": false
        },
        ...
      ],
      "config": []
    },
    {
      "id": 194,
      ...
      "option_values": [
        {
          "id": 166,
          "label": "Blue",
          "sort_order": 1,
          "value_data": {
            "colors": [
              "#123C91"
            ]
          },
        },
          ...

      ],
      "config": []
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    ...
    }
  }
}
```

In the preceding response, there are two variant options: size and color. Each has three values; the product comes in three sizes and three colors. Each variant option contains an array of multiple values.

To create the corresponding product variants and their SKUs, use the [Create a product variant]() endpoint. You can create one variant at a time using this endpoint.

To create variants in the same call as the base product, use the [Create a product]() endpoint.

The following example shows a variant option object for a product's size. The `option_values` array lists the possible sizes for the product.

The `id` at the root level of the object is the ID of the variant option.

The IDs in the `option_values` array are the IDs of the variant option values.

```json filename="Example variant option object" showLineNumbers copy
{
  "id": 193, //option_id
  "product_id": 134,
  "name": "Size1533313432-134",
  "display_name": "Size",
  "type": "rectangles",
  "sort_order": 0,
  "option_values": [
    {
        "id": 163, //id
        "label": "S",
        "sort_order": 0,
        "value_data": null,
        "is_default": false
    },
    {
        "id": 164, //id
        "label": "M",
        "sort_order": 0,
        "value_data": null,
        "is_default": true
    },
    {
        "id": 165, //id
        "label": "L",
        "sort_order": 0,
        "value_data": null,
        "is_default": false
    }
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Create a variant using the product endpoint

The following example creates a base product, variant options, and variants in a single call to the [Create a product]() endpoint. Use this method to create a product and variants in a single call without creating variant options first. 

```http filename="Example request: Create a product" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/catalog/products
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "name": "BigCommerce Coffee Mug",
  "price": 10.00,
  "categories": [
    23,
    21
  ],
  "weight": 4,
  "type": "physical",
  "variants": [
    {
      "sku": "SKU-BLU",
      "option_values": [
        {
          "option_display_name": "Mug Color",
          "label": "Blue"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "sku": "SKU-GRAY",
      "option_values": [
        {
          "option_display_name": "Mug Color",
          "label": "Gray"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The option display type defaults to radio button. Additional option display types include swatch, rectangle, dropdown, product list, and product list with images.

## Product modifiers

[Product modifiers](/docs/rest-catalog/product-modifiers#get-all-product-modifiers) represent choices that the shopper can make to change how the merchant customizes or adds on to the product. Examples include:
* Shipping insurance
* Monograms
* Text to be engraved on the product
* Custom inseam length
* A color selection for an unfinished product

Modifiers do not typically change which item is “picked off the shelf” in a warehouse, but they change what happens to that product between the warehouse shelf and the shopper taking possession of the product.

Critically, the modifier does not change which product variant is fulfilled. You cannot track inventory for combinations of modifier values.

Modifier options can be required, but do not have to be.
* Support all option types
* Cannot be used as part of a variant

You can add an adjuster to a modifier option to change things, such as increasing the price, changing the weight, or shipping rules.  You cannot apply adjusters to all modifier types.

### Modifier options example


| Product | Variant option values | Variant | Modifier |
|:--------|:----------------------|:--------|:---------|
| T-Shirt | Blue; Small, Medium, Large| BLU-LRG | Checkbox - Donate to Charity |
| Backpack | Black, Yellow; 2L, 3L, 8L | YELLOW-8L | Text Field - Add Embroidery|

<Callout type="info">
  #### Modifiers that support adjusters
  Swatch, radio button, rectangle list, drop-down, product list, and product list with images.
</Callout>



### Add a modifier with price adjuster to an existing product

The following example shows how to add a modifier and a checkbox with a price adjuster to increase the product's price by five dollars.

Creating a checkbox with an adjuster requires two separate calls: one to create the checkbox and another one to add the adjuster. You can define adjusters within the `option_values` array, but `option_values` are not allowed in the request to create a checkbox modifier because creating a checkbox automatically generates two mandatory option values: `Yes` and `No`. Once you have created the checkbox and its option values, you can update the modifier to add an adjuster.

<Callout type="info">
  #### Modifiers that require a second step to add an adjuster
  Swatch, radio button, drop-down, rectangle list, product list, product list with images, and checkbox.
</Callout>

        "product_id": "The product is currently associated with an option set, please remove it before editing an option or modifier."
    }
}
```

To fix this error:

* Modify the products using the V2 API.
* Remove the option set using the V2 API or the control panel, then remake the variants and modifiers using V3.

## Complex rules

[Complex rules](/docs/rest-management/catalog/product-complex-rules#get-complex-rules) allow merchants to set up conditions and actions based on shopper option selections on the storefront. You can use them to vary the following based on the shopper's option selections:
* Price
* Weight
* Image
* Purchasability

Adjustments made by complex rules are displayed to shoppers in real-time on the storefront.

For most merchant use cases, **best practice** will be to either assign values (such as a price) directly to a variant or use adjusters on the modifier option itself. However, complex rules exist for rare cases where a rule condition is too complex to express in those forms easily.

Use complex rules when an adjustment should be triggered by:
* The selection of values across multiple modifier options.
* The combination of a particular variant/SKU and a modifier option value.

### Complex rules example

| Product | Variant option | Variant |Modifier | Complex rule |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| T-Shirt | Blue<br />-<br /> Small<br /> Medium<br /> Large| SM-BLU<br /> SM-MED <br /> SM-LARG| Checkbox<br />Donate to Charity| Checkbox<br /> Donate to Charity.<br /> Add $5
| Backpack | Black<br />Yellow<br />-<br />2L <br /> 3L<br /> 8L |BLACK-2L<br />BLACK-3L<br />BLACK 8L<br />-<br />YELLOW-2L<br />YELLOW-3L<br />YELLOW-8L| Text Field<br /> Add Embroidery| N/A

<br />

### Creating complex rules based on modifiers

Complex rules must have a combination of two or more modifiers, such as two checkboxes. The following example request to the [Create a complex rule](/api-reference/store-management/catalog/product-complex-rules/createcomplexrule) endpoint will add $10 to the product price when you check both boxes.

```http filename="Example request: Create a complex rule" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/catalog/products/{{product_id}}/complex-rules
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "product_id": 1200,
  "enabled": true,
  "price_adjuster": {
    "adjuster_value": 10
  },
  "conditions": [
    {
      "modifier_id": 506,
      "modifier_value_id": 852
    },
    {
      "modifier_id": 507,
      "modifier_value_id": 854
    }
  ]
}
```


### Troubleshooting: 422 Errors

Complex rules must consist of multiple conditions that trigger the rule adjustment. If multiple conditions are not specified, the request will return a 422 error.

```json filename="Example error: complex rules" showLineNumbers copy
{
    "status": 422,
    "title": "The rule must contain multiple modifier conditions with unique modifier ids or a variant condition and modifier condition",
    "type": "https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api#api-status-codes"
}
```

## Creating brands

To create a brand, send a request to the [Create a brand](/api-reference/store-management/catalog/brands/createbrand) endpoint.


```http filename="Example request: Create a brand" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/catalog/brands
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "name": "BigCommerce",
  "page_title": "BigCommerce",
  "meta_keywords": [
    "ecommerce",
    "best in class",
    "grow your business"
  ],
  "image_url": "{{image_url}}"
}
```

For general information on brands and their use cases, see [Managing Brands](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Managing-Brands).

## Categories

[Categories](/docs/rest-management/catalog/category#get-all-categories) are a hierarchy of products available on the store, presented in a tree structure. A store's category structure determines the primary menu structure of most storefront themes directly tied to it.

BigCommerce's V3 REST API does not require products to be associated with a category during creation. You can add new products to a catalog without a category, which can be assigned later if desired. A store's category can contain multiple products or no products at all and still be valid. 

You can associate products with multiple categories. A product associated with categories does not currently have any priority or weighted order (there's no “primary category”). The absence of priority or weighted order makes it difficult to integrate with some external systems that might wish to use a product's categories to map to a category structure.

The following is an example request to the **single storefront** [Create a category](/api-reference/store-management/catalog/category/createcategory) endpoint. To work with categories in a multi-storefront or multi-channel context, use the [batch categories endpoints](/api-reference/store-management/catalog/categories-batch/createcategories) and consult the [categories section of the Multi-Storefront API Guide](/api-docs/multi-storefront/api-guide#categories).

```http filename="Example request: Create a category, single storefront" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/catalog/categories
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "parent_id": 18,
  "name": "Shoes",
  "description": "Shoes Available for purchase",
  "sort_order": 1,
  "page_title": "Shoes",
  "is_visible": true
}
```

## Category trees

Product categories can have their own subcategories. The relationship hierarchy of a store or storefront's categories is called a **category tree**. Category trees belong to channels. In a single storefront store, channel `1` is the only channel.

The following is a series of example requests to the [Get all category trees](/api-reference/store-management/catalog/category-trees/getcategorytrees) endpoint and [Get a category tree](/api-reference/store-management/catalog/category-trees/getacategorytree) endpoint to retrieve the category tree for channel `1`.

## Product Sort Order

[Product Sort Order](/docs/rest-management/catalog/product-sort-order#get-product-sort-order) allows you to manage the sort order of products displayed on any given category page. Products assigned to multiple storefront categories can have different sort order values per category.

### Product sorting on a storefront 

The Catalog API supports two manually managed methods of product sorting: on a category level and a product level. If a user combines both sorting methods on a storefront, products with sort order values on a category level take priority. If there is no sort order value on a category level, the Catalog API sorts products by values on a product level.

Product sorting methods:

1. Manually specified sort order on a category level.
2. Manually specified sort order on a product level. `0` by default. 

<Callout type="info">
  Products with the same sort order value either on a category or a product level are sorted by `product id` as a second criterion.
</Callout>
