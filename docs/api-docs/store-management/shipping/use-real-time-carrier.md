# Use a Real-Time Carrier

Shipping carriers provide real-time shipping quotes to merchants and shoppers. You can use native integrations or a shipping provider apps to obtain real-time quotes from carriers. For more info, see the [Real Time Shipping Quotes](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Setting-Up-a-Real-Time-Shipping-Quote-Shipping-Method?language=en_US) support article.  

The following figure shows how to make real-time carrier quotes available during checkout. A store owner must install an app in the control panel. You can do all other steps through the control panel or API. Note that you can set up a different shipping method for each shipping zone a carrier services. 

![Real-Time Carrier Workflow](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/images/real-time-carrier-workflow.png 'Workflow for setting up a real-time carrier')

This guide shows you how to use the [Shipping V2 API](/api-reference/store-management/shipping-api) to manage carrier connections and real-time shipping methods.

## Prerequisites
- For shipping provider apps only: Store owner installs the shipping provider app. 
- You have an `access_token` from the merchant [store's API account](/api-docs/getting-started/authentication/rest-api-authentication) that has the [OAuth Scope](/api-docs/getting-started/authentication/rest-api-authentication#oauth-scopes): `Information & Settings`.
- The store has shipping zones. You can create zones with the [Create a shipping zone](/api-reference/store-management/shipping-api/shipping-zones/createashippingzones) endpoint.

> #### Native integrations
> BigCommerce offers native integrations with shipping services, including FedEx and national postal services. For a list of integrations, see the [Setting up Real Time Shipping Quotes](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Setting-Up-a-Real-Time-Shipping-Quote-Shipping-Method#providers) support article.

## Manage connections to shipping carriers 

When a store owner installs a shipping provider app, the carrier appears in the **Settings > Shipping** section of the store control panel, in the **Real-time Shipping Quotes** view. However, you must first connect the carrier to a store. 

![Connected vs Installed Carrier](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/images/Installed%20vs%20Connected%20Carrier.png 'Connected versus Installed Carrier. USPS is connected, while FedEx is only installed.')  

### Create a connection

To connect a carrier, send a request to the [Create a carrier connection](/api-reference/store-management/shipping-api/shipping-carrier/postshippingcarrierconnection) endpoint. Include the carrier ID and any connection fields that the carrier requires. Connection fields are unique to each carrier. 

<!--

```json title="Example request: Create a connection" lineNumbers
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v2/shipping/carrier/connection
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{	
  "carrier_id": "endicia",
  "connection": {
    "account_id": "example_id",

  }
}
```

<!--

```json title="Example response: Create a connection" lineNumbers
HTTP 204 No content
```

<!-- type: tab-end -->

If a carrier doesnâ€™t require connection settings, send an empty object for the `connection` property.

<!--
type: tab
title: Request
-->

```json title="Example request: Create a connection without connection fields" lineNumbers
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v2/shipping/carrier/connection

Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{

  "connection": {}
}
```

<!--

-->

```json title="Example response: Create a connection without connection fields" lineNumbers
HTTP 204 No content
```

<!-- type: tab-end -->

### Update a connection

To update a connection, send a request to the [Update a carrier connection](/api-reference/store-management/shipping-api/shipping-carrier/updateacarrierconnection) endpoint. Use the same connection fields as [Create a connection](#create-a-connection). 

<!--
type: tab
title: Request

```json title="Example request: Update a connection" lineNumbers
PUT https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v2/shipping/carrier/connection

{	
  "carrier_id": "endicia",
  "connection": {
    "account_id": "example_id_2",
    "pass_phrase": "example_passphrase"
  }
}
```

<!--
type: tab
title: Response
-->

```json title="Example response: Update a connection" lineNumbers
HTTP 204 No content
```

<!-- type: tab-end -->

### Delete a connection

To delete a connection, send a request to the [Delete a carrier connection](/api-reference/store-management/shipping-api/shipping-carrier/deletecarrierconnection) endpoint and specify the `carrier_id` in the request body.

<!--
type: tab
title: Request
-->

```json title="Example request: Delete a connection" lineNumbers
DELETE https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v2/shipping/carrier/connection
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

}
```

<!--

```json title="Example response: Delete a connection" lineNumbers
HTTP 204 No content
```

<!-- type: tab-end -->


## Manage shipping methods

After you connect a carrier, set up a shipping method for the carrier in one or more shipping zones. You can define and enable a different shipping method for each zone the carrier services.

### Create a shipping method

To create a shipping method for a carrier, send a request to the [Create a shipping method](/api-reference/store-management/shipping-api/shipping-method/createashippingmethod) endpoint. Specify the shipping zone in the path using the zone ID (`id`) from the [Get all shipping zones](/api-reference/store-management/shipping-api/shipping-zones/getallshippingzones) endpoint.

The response provides an `id` for the shipping method. Use the `id` to get, update, or delete a shipping method.
